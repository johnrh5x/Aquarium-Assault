Hi!

Aquarium Assault: Dark Day for a Dogfish is a simple, arcade-style game based on Rock Paper Shotgun's Electronic Wireless Show podcast.  You play as a humble aquarium attendant with a passion for the piscine.  Your job is to be a light unto the non-fish masses.  Greet them as the enter the aquarium, prevent them from tapping on the fishtank, and, above all, protect the dogfish from the vague but nefarious schemes of Mr. Basil Pesto.

Aquarium Assault is written in Java using the LibGDX game framework.  LibGDX is open-source software and uses the Apache 2.0 license.  The source files stored here represent only the code specific to this game and are not sufficient to compile the game yourself.  (This is just an online backup of my local Git repository.)  If you're interested in learning more about LibGDX, visit https://libGDX.com.

This repository includes a playable, feature-complete build of the game.  The file desktop-1.0.jar is an executable jar file.  To play, download the file, make sure you have Java installed, and launch the game either from the command line by typing "java -jar desktop-1.0.jar" or by double- or right-clicking on the file in your file browser.  The ability to launch the game from your file browser may depend on your operating system, your preferred application settings, the permissions you have assigned to the file, and various other mysterious and inscrutable factors for which I cannot be held responsible.  The command line is the far more reliable alternative.

I am currently in the process of polishing the game and packaging it with a minimal JRE so that it does not require Java to be installed, but I can't say yet when that process will be complete.

Thanks for your time!
